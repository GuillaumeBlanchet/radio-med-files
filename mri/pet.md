## PET scan of the human brain

    Neurology: PET neuroimaging is based on an assumption that areas of high radioactivity are associated with brain activity. What is actually measured indirectly is the flow of blood to different parts of the brain, which is, in general, believed to be correlated, and has been measured using the tracer oxygen-15. Because of its 2-minute half-life, O-15 must be piped directly from a medical cyclotron for such uses, which is difficult.
